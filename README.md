# Employee-CRUD-with-Thymeleaf-and-Spring-Boot
The Employee Manager is a web-based application that enables administrators to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on employee data. The application is built using Thymeleaf and Spring Boot, making it easy to customize and extend the functionality to meet specific business needs.

With this application, administrators can quickly and easily manage employee data, including personal information, job details, and salary information. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

The application's back-end is powered by Spring Boot, which provides a secure and robust framework for building enterprise-grade web applications. The application leverages Spring Boot's built-in security features to ensure that user data is protected from unauthorized access.

Thymeleaf, a popular server-side Java template engine, is used to generate dynamic HTML pages that can be rendered on the client-side. This allows the application to deliver a faster, more responsive user experience by reducing server load and network traffic.

Overall, the Employee CRUD web application provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing employee data in a secure and efficient manner. Its use of Thymeleaf and Spring Boot make it a modern and scalable solution for businesses of all sizes.
